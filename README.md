# lf-proxy
Proxy app for bringing all features together

## Running

In each directory, you need to create a .env file for database usernames, 
passwords, hosts, and the PORT number for each proxy.

You also need to run 
``` sh
npm install
npm start
npm run react:dev
```

For each proxy (comment, related, user, player).

Then in the root, run:
``` sh
npm install
npm start
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on a browser.
